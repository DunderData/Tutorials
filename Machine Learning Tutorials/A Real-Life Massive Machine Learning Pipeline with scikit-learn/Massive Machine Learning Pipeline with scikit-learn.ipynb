    "# Massive Machine Learning Pipelines with scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to build a scikit-learn pipeline that takes in raw data, transforms many different subsets of data, learns from it, tunes hyperparameters and is then able to make predictions. The final outcome will be a single sckit-learn estimator that does it all. This estimator will then be able to be used in the future to make predictions in a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial includes information on how to:\n",
    "* Categorize columns into distinct groups\n",
    "* Apply independent transformations to each column grouping\n",
    "* Create a single pipline that handles all the steps of transforming, modeling, validating, and predicting\n",
    "* Build custom transformers to create new features\n",
    "* Save our final model to disk to be used to make future predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus on transformations\n",
    "Although this builds a complete machine learning pipeline, most of it will focus on how to transform and prepare the data for the machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assume fundamentals of scikit-learn\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you are familiar with doing machine learning with scikit-learn. At a minimum, you need to know what a scikit-learn estimator is and how it behaves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior Issues with transformations in scikit-learn\n",
    "Up until the release of scikit-learn version 0.20 in September, 2018, there was no easy way to apply separate transformations to different subsets of the data. Additionally burdensome, was encoding of categorical features. For instance, building a single pipeline to handle input data that contained a mix of continuous and categorical variables was not trivial and a huge issue. Many divergent workflows were built to accommodate such transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of the `ColumnTransformer` and upgrade to the `OneHotEncoder` in version 0.20 alleviated these painful issues. Building an entire pipeline in scikit-learn was not pleasant before these additions. A previous post of mine details the exciting new workflow that became possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Data\n",
    "In this post, we will work with the [Ames, Iowa housing dataset][0] from a popular Kaggle competition. You are given a dataset with 79 features with the objective of learning a model to predict the sale price.\n",

Each group will undergo its own set of transformations before being used as input in the machine learning model.

As we will see, there are different groups of columns than just categorical or continuous and each column group will have its own set of transformations."
